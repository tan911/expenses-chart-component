## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM (naming)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/scss
- [Chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

As a novice, this is my first time working locally with a JSON file and integrating it with chartjs. It's been a great learning experience, but I'm not sure if I implemented it correctly, so I'm leaving it the way it is.

One of the most important lessons from this process is that occasionally using a CDN is preferable than downloading it locally. This is because I have a difficulty while working with charts (using npm), and whenever I try to use it (after obviously reading the documentation - a guide), it always throws me an error for no apparent reason.
However, the documentation advises utilizing any bundlers if you downloaded it locally, therefore I choose to use CDN to address my problem rather than using bundlers üòÇüëè.

### Continued development

The tooltip and bar chart are functioning fine, but I need to take a closer look to determine what design is behind the lack of a space between the tooltip and bar chart and that's the thing¬†I want to address in the future.
